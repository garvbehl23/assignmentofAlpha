# Doctor Survey Attendance Predictor

## Overview
This project predicts doctors (based on NPIs) likely to attend a survey at a specific time. It uses machine learning and provides a web app for user input and CSV export.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains doctor details like Speciality, Region, Login/Logout Time, Time spent, and Count of Attempts.

## Features
- Input: Time of day (hour, e.g., 6 for 6:00 AM).
- Output: List of doctors (NPIs) likely to attend the survey.
- Download: Export results as a CSV file.
- Polished UI with progress bar and dynamic feedback.

## How It Works
1. Input: User enters a specific hour (0â€“23).
2. Processing: Filters doctors and predicts likelihood using a trained model.
3. Output: Displays and exports predicted NPIs as a CSV file.
